## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive optimization framework for a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) combining solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. The system is designed to minimize operational costs while meeting energy demand through intelligent resource allocation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-source Integration**: Combines solar, wind, and storage technologies
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes total energy production and storage costs
- **Demand-Supply Matching**: Ensures reliable energy supply with deficit penalties
- **Advanced Visualization**: Multiple interactive visualizations for performance analysis
- **Parameter Optimization**: Finds optimal efficiency parameters for each energy source

## 🏗️ System Configuration

| Component | Capacity | Cost | Efficiency |
|-----------|----------|------|------------|
| Solar PV | 100 kW | $0.12/kWh | 10-30% (optimized) |
| Wind Turbines | 150 kW | $0.10/kWh | 20-40% (optimized) |
| Battery Storage | 200 kWh | $0.05/kWh | 0-100% utilization |

## 📊 Data Requirements

The system requires two input CSV files:

1. **Weather Data** (`weather_data.csv`):
   - `solar_irradiance` (kW/m²)
   - `wind_speed` (m/s)

2. **Demand Data** (`demand_data.csv`):
   - `energy_demand` (kWh)

🧮 Mathematical Model
Objective Function
Minimize total cost:

text
Total Cost = (Solar Energy × $0.12) + 
             (Wind Energy × $0.10) + 
             (Storage Usage × $0.05) + 
             (Energy Deficit × $0.15)
Energy Production Models
Solar Production:

python
solar_output = irradiance × MAX_SOLAR_CAPACITY × efficiency
Wind Production:

python
wind_output = wind_speed × MAX_WIND_CAPACITY × efficiency × adjustment_factor
# adjustment_factor = 0.5 if wind_speed < 10 m/s, else 1.0
📈 Optimization Process
The system uses Truncated Newton Algorithm (TNC) to optimize three parameters:

Solar panel efficiency (10-30%)

Wind turbine efficiency (20-40%)

Storage utilization fraction (0-100%)

🎨 Visualizations
The project generates four comprehensive visualizations:

Production Breakdown: Daily solar, wind, and storage contributions vs demand

Total vs Demand: Aggregate renewable output compared to energy requirements

Energy Flow Sankey: Interactive flow diagram showing energy distribution

Heatmap Analysis: Daily surplus/deficit patterns across the month
